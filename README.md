<h2><u>Project Overview</u></h2>

<h3>Homeless Outreach Client Database with GIS Functionality</h3>

This project aims to develop a comprehensive database system for homeless outreach clients, enhanced with GIS capabilities to track client locations over time. By integrating Angular, Spring Boot, and MySQL, this platform allows outreach workers to record, access, and visualize the geographic data of clients they serve. This real-time location tracking enables more effective coordination among service providers, ensuring timely access to housing and other critical resources.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

The purpose of this system is to address the logistical challenges faced by homeless service programs, particularly the difficulty in locating clients who may frequently change locations. The GIS functionality allows outreach workers to mark and view the locations where interactions with clients occur. This not only optimizes the search process during time-sensitive opportunities but also provides valuable data on client movement patterns and high-activity areas, aiding in better service planning and delivery.

<h3>Key Features</h3>

GIS Mapping: Visual representation of client locations to streamline the search and rescue efforts.

Comprehensive Client Profiles: Centralized database for storing detailed information about each client.

Collaborative Platform: Enables multiple users to update and share crucial information seamlessly.

Security and Privacy: Ensures compliance with privacy laws through robust authentication mechanisms and client consent protocols.

<h3>Impact</h3>
This project is designed to enhance the operational efficiency of homeless outreach services and contribute to more effective community planning. By providing a technology solution that addresses real-life challenges, it aims to improve the quality of life for homeless individuals and support the efforts of service providers.
